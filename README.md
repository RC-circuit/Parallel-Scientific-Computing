# Parallel-Scientific-Computing

Coursework done at IIT Madras in Jan-May 24 semester, offered by Dr. Kameswararao Anupindi. The course deals with three main parallel programming packages
- OpenMP
- OpenMPI
- OpenACC
Each of them has an assignment as attached above. The course concludes with a project. The project I picked was, parallelizing deep neural networks for steady state heat conduction problems. Feel free to take motivation from the codes shared.
